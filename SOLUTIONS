PROJECT
Project 1: Zip Schedule In addition to creating schedules, Zip Schedules also allows you to 
save favorite schedules as templates so that you can quickly create a new schedule 
suitable to your needs. Save time on common tasks required to create a schedule by 
dropping the shifts into employee slots rather than creating a new one each time.

Project 2: Zip Clock is the simple and most affordable way for business owners to control, 
track, and review employee time and compliance with work schedules. It saves employers 
money by prompting managers and supervisors before labor law violations occur. Always 
know who is on the clock and who is sticking to their schedule with our online employee 
time clock.

Project 3: Zip Forecast plans your next schedule and knows your demand (based on 
sales and transactions) well in advance. Reduce over and under-scheduling with staff 
forecasts on 15, 30, or 60-minute intervals. And use our easy-to-use budgeting tools for 
additional labor cost control.
